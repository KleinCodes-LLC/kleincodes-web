<h1>StoryChef Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>StoryChef does not collect any user identifiable data. We do collect crash reports to make the app as stable as possible. We also store the stories that are created, but not who created them. The metadata associated with a created story includes the nouns/ingredients used, the story itself, the date the story was created, the image that was created, and the story modifiers including an adjective, sample author, and genre. Again, no user data is collected. If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach out to support@kleincodes.com. Thank you!</p>
