    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 1, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to StoryChef! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the StoryChef mobile application ("App") operated by KleinCodes, LLC ("we," "us," or "our"). By using StoryChef, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
    <p>StoryChef allows parents and children to create custom bedtime stories by inputting words (nouns and adjectives). The app uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate a story and illustration.</p>
    <p>You agree to use StoryChef only for lawful purposes and in a way that does not infringe on the rights of others or restrict anyone else's use of the app.</p>

    <h2>2. AI-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>StoryChef uses a large language model (LLM) to generate text and images. While we aim to provide family-friendly results, we <strong>cannot guarantee</strong> that all AI-generated content — including illustrations — will be appropriate for all audiences.</p>
    <p><strong>By using StoryChef, you acknowledge and accept that we are not liable for any content generated by the AI, including but not limited to illustrations or text that may be unexpected, inappropriate, offensive, or harmful.</strong></p>
    <p>We recommend that parents review the content before sharing it with children.</p>

    <h2>3. User Input and Conduct</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for any content or prompts you provide to the app. You agree not to input anything illegal, harmful, offensive, or that infringes on the rights of others. We are not responsible for the nature, tone, or accuracy of generated content resulting from your input.</p>

    <h2>4. Parental Responsibility</h2>
    <p>StoryChef is designed for use by parents and guardians with their children. We strongly encourage that an adult reviews and supervises all use of the app to ensure the content is appropriate for the child.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party services such as Firebase for app performance monitoring and anonymous analytics. These services may collect non-personal, aggregated usage data to help us improve the app experience. We do not collect or store any personal data.</p>
    <p>For more information on Firebase, please refer to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All intellectual property rights in StoryChef — including the app, name, software, and logo — are owned by us. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works based on the app without our prior written consent.</p>
    <p>You retain any rights to the prompts you provide and the output generated, but acknowledge that we are not responsible for the content’s nature or use.</p>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the app at any time, without notice, if we believe you have violated these Terms or misused the app.</p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>StoryChef is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties and will not be liable for any damages arising from your use of or inability to use the app, including any content generated by it.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
